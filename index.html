          <span class="title mb-5">Founder & CEO</span>
          <p>Dr. Subramaniam is globally recognized for his leading contributions in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). He was the first to show that protein structures at resolutions of ~ 2 Å could be determined using cryo-EM methods. He was also the first to show that cryo-EM could be used to visualize drug binding to clinically relevant targets at atomic resolution. revolutionizing the landscape of drug discovery. Dr. Subramaniam has continued to stay at the forefront of the cryo-EM field by advancing the technology and repeatedly demonstrating that clinical important protein targets can be visualized at high resolution using cryo-EM. </p>
          <p>His other significant contributions include structural studies of membrane proteins using electron crystallography, in the development of electron tomographic methods to study HIV-1, influenza and related viruses for vaccine development, and in pioneering new based technologies for cell and tissue imaging based on focused ion beams.  </p>
          <p>Sriram received his PhD in Physical Chemistry from Stanford University and completed postdoctoral training in the Departments of Chemistry and Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
